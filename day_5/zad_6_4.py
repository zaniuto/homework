# The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year.
# Each spring, it doubles in height.
# Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.

# Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring.
# How tall will her tree be after n growth cycles?

# For example, if the number of growth cycles is n=5, the calculations are as follows:

# Period  Height
# 0          1
# 1          2
# 2          3
# 3          6
# 4          7
# 5          14

cycle = [0, 1, 4, 3, 27]
# answer [1, 2, 7, 6, 32766]
